# Agile User Stories


## Purpose of a User Story
User requirements in Agile are called User Stories. Rather than spend months creating for a business requirements document (BRD) that lists all the things “the system shall” do, user stories represent things people want to do. Light on detail, they are designed to be placeholders for conversations.User stories act as a focal point to facilitate conversation between many people.![Stories Value](media/stories-value.png)

### User Story Format
The user story format is designed to ensure you capture the three most important aspects of a story. Who it is for, what they want to do, and why they want to do it.
