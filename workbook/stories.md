# Agile User Stories


## Purpose of a User Story
User requirements in Agile are called User Stories. Rather than spend months creating a business requirements document (BRD) that lists all the things “the system shall” do, user stories represent things people <em>want</em> to do. Light on detail, they are designed to be placeholders for conversations.User stories act as a focal point to facilitate conversation between many people.![Stories Value](media/stories-value.png)

### User Story Format
The user story format is designed to ensure you capture the three most important aspects of a story. Who it is for, what they want to do, and why they want to do it.

### Story Size
Stories are kept small enough that multiple can be completed within a short time period (for example a two-week sprint in Scrum).

This has several benefits. It creates focus (we're only looking at a few small requirements at a time). We can deliver small pieces of value early. It allows business to reprioritize continually as they learn. 

Small stories are challenging as well. It can require creativity and collaboration to figure out how to break stories down. Trying to keep many small stories in a backlog can get confusing. Delivering small pieces of functionality on a frequent basis requires a lot of attention to technical quality (e.g., automated testing and code refactoring practices).
