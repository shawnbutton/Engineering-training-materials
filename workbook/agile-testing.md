# Agile Testing

### Testing Quadrants

To help bring clarity to the complicated subject of testing Brian Merrick created the "Testing Quadrants." He separated types of testing into four domains, as in the diagram below.

Tests on the left <em>support the team</em> during development. They are used to help drive development of the product.

Tests on the right <em>critique the product</em>. They are used to verify that the product meets, and continues to meet, the requirements.

Tests on the top are <em>business facing</em>. Business can understand them, and should be interested in them.

Tests on the bottom are <em>product facing</em>. They test the product, but might not be interesting for non-technical business folks.


#### Bottom-Left - Technology-Facing Supporting Development

This is the domain of automated unit and component tests. Your business is probably not interested in seeing these tests (although they love the confidence that comes from knowing you are writing them). They support the team because they allow the team to quickly evolve and add new features to the code.
In particular Test-Driven Development (TDD) is in this quadrant. Writing code using TDD helps you think through the requirements in an incremental fashion, and having the TDD tests allows to you refactor continuously to keep your code clean enabling you to move fast.

#### Top-Left - Biz Facing Supporting Development

These tests help you clarify your understanding of the product with business. Processes like Acceptance-Test-Driven-Development (ATDD) use the clarity that comes from writing tests collaboratively to ensure that there is alignment between business and developers. You might automate some of these tests to create an automated regression suite run as part of your pipeline, but some test could be run manually.

#### Bottom-Right - Technology-Facing Critiquing The Product

These tests verify that the product meets non-functional requirements such as performance, load and security. Business people probably don't want to see these tests, but, again, love to hear that you are running them. Often people will use tools to perform these tests, but this quadrant typically introduces an element of manual effort. Continuous Delivery requires that you include these tests as part of your pipeline.

#### Top-Right - Business-Facing Critiquing The Product

These tests verify that the product does what it should from a business and user perspective. Often manual, these tests use human intelligence to ensure the product is as good as we can create.


## Questions

In which quadrant would you put these tests?
	
a. Unit tests written after the code is complete  

b. A/B tests checking the usage of various versions of a web page in production
	
c. 	Integration tests checking that your application correctly calls a database

	
d. Tests ensuring that the contact of your web service is correct


```
a.

b.

c.

d.

```
	

2. 	What would need to change with how you test in order to do Continuous Delivery?

```









```

3. Some people in the testing community prefer the team <b>checks</b> for automated tests, reserving the term <b>tests</b> for tests done by a human. Why do you think they make this distinction?
