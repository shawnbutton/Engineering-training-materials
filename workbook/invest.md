# I.N.V.E.S.T. IN GOOD USER STORIES
<strong>I.N.V.E.S.T.</strong> is a mnemonic created by Bill Wake as a reminder of the characteristics of a good quality user story. It makes a good initial <em>Definition of Ready</em>.
<br>
<strong>Independent</strong> - Does this story have dependencies? We should be able to release it independent from other stories.
<br>
<strong>Negotiable</strong> - A story card is a placeholder for a conversation, scope is up for negotiation between the business and team.
<br>
<strong>Valuable</strong> - The story should have demonstrated business value to the organization whether it be reduction of tech debt or features that will get new customers.
<br>
<strong>Estimable</strong> - We must know enough about the story to estimate it, otherwise it needs to be broken down or a ‘spike’ needs to be done to learn more.
<br>
<strong>Sized Right (Small)</strong> - A story must fit within the Sprint timebox otherwise it must be broken down.
<br>
<strong>Testable</strong> - We must understand what ‘done’ is and the stories acceptance criteria must be unambiguous.<br>
