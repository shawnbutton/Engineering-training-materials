# String Calculator 5

Support different delimiters:

To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: `//[delimiter]\n[numbers]`.

For example `//;\n1;2` should return `3` where the delimiter is `;`.

The first line is optional. All existing scenarios should still be supported.
